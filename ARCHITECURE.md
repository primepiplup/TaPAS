# Architecuture

## Software Stack

### Domain/API
The domain logic, as well as the API endpoints and all outward-facing aspects of the application will be written in Rust.\
For the purpose of creating API endpoints to interface through the Rocket framework will be used.

### Front-end
The front-end of the program will be written in Svelte. This choice was made because the framework looked interesting, I liked the idea of compilation into small and performant pieces of HTML/CSS/JS where the framework is removed at build-time.
