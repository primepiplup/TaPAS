# TaPAS's a Personal Analysis Suite

## Personal Goals

 - Stay open and social even when submerged deep into project
 - Try to keep things simple and just implement things - everything doesn't have to be perfectly defined at the start

## Technical Goals

 - Use Rust for a non-trivial project (Domain logic and API endpoints)
 - Do asynchronous programming in Rust (and use Lifetimes)
