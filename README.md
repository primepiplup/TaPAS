## MoSCoW
### Must
 - Intake tagged information
 - Deliver tagged information
 - Visualize tagged information
 - Categorical comparison of continuous data (visualized - t-test)
 - Linear regression against continuous data (visualized)
### Should
 - Edit tagged information
 - Batch edit
 - Provide goal reach date estimation based on analysis
### Could
 - Include other (potentially) relevant statistical analysis methods
 - Other information tracking features for non-numerical information
### Would (won't)
 - Vague dimensionality reduction analysis like PCA
 - Neural networks
 - Random forest
 

## Personal Goals

 - Stay open and social even when submerged deep into project
 - Try to keep things simple and just implement things - everything doesn't have to be perfectly defined at the start

## Technical Goals

 - Use Rust for a non-trivial project (Domain logic and API endpoints)
 - Do asynchronous programming in Rust (and use Lifetimes)
