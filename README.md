## MoSCoW
### Must
 - Intake tagged information
 - Deliver tagged information
 - Visualize tagged information
 - Categorical comparison of continuous data (visualized - t-test)
 - Linear regression against continuous data (visualized)
### Should
 - Display buttons to apply tags to ease information ingress
 - Edit information tags, apply new tags, remove, etc.
 - Batch edit for ease of use and analysis
 - Provide goal reach date estimation based on analysis
### Could
 - Include other (potentially) relevant statistical analysis methods
 - Other information tracking features for non-numerical information
 - Apply external information sources/projection/models on user data
### Would (won't)
 - Vague dimensionality reduction analysis like PCA
 - Neural networks
 - Random forest
 

## Personal Goals

 - Bouncing ideas off of others helps with figuring out problems, even if they don't immediately know the answer themselves. I would like to talk more about the thoughts I am having and to have them looked at/tested by my peers.
 - Try to keep things small and simple, implement compartmentalized features - everything doesn't have to be perfectly defined at the start. If all elements are well thought out a well thought-out architecture will emerge.

## Technical Goals

 - Use Rust for a non-trivial project (Domain logic and API endpoints)
 - Do asynchronous programming in Rust (and use Lifetimes)
